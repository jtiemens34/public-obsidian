# What to AFK at work
- event:
	- prio summ for saving time collecting mats early game
	- pray is incidental from any other training
	- arch
		- prolly not that worth bc early game arch prog isn't really about xp, but completing mysteries and filling collections
	- thieve
		- can skip the annoying early game world hop + open doors bs
	- potentially alternate between summ/thieve every other day
- runespan:
	- 1-5: mind storm + cyclone
	- 5: water pool
	- 9: rock fragment
	- 14: fireball
	- 17: vine
	- vine > fire storm
	- 20: fleshy growth
	- 33 -> go mid-level, will have to climb instead of using portal til 50 rc
	- 35: chaotic cloud
	- 40: nebula
	- 44: shifter
- later:
	- m&s
	- gem rocks
# Path Modifications
- **BIG: move necro to after step 53 (wmiy)**
	- prereqs for area tasks before starting necro
	- when to kill skele with a skele, there's one by mage of zammy in wildy, prolly do during the step for talking to jeffrey for gunnar's ground
	- task lamp goes on herb, because herby werby + 2x double ljot should get me to 20 herb
- Get 7 bronze bars instead on step 7
- Don't bank jug of water before going to ardy
- don't do 5x stone 5x clay in ana, do whatever you don't have from the tut
- After VIB2, mine 14 iron ore in tav mine
- while in barb village, get 4 coal for upgrading necro weps and steel ore box
- while in barb village, cut and burn some logs for ashes for ink for necro
	- hm?
	- reg ink glyphs req, so 4 reg ink, 80 lesser necro, 4 ashes
		- rune mythos
			- 2 ele 1, 2 change 1
		- if i do kili row after rune mythos i can keep the glyphs that i'll need for ensouling for the upgrades
			- 2 ele 1, 1 change 1
- Skip step 30, just pick it up before icthlarin's lil helper
- Step 40 buy 2 packs of vials of water
- Gunnar's ground xp lamp on con will stay in the inv for a while. i did 1 god statue + 1 extra goulash to make it happen, the goulash i didn't put on fletch didn't seem to matter, wouldn't have gotten me to lvl 2 anyways, no extra speed up there or quest req
	- if i do sus before gunnars, i should be 5 con to use the lamp from restoring statues
- after 25 qp, when passing by bob in lumbridge, buy all picks/hatchets
- Don't do shattered worlds
# Schedule
## Sunday
- [x] try public sus on eletestrun
	- [ ] notes:
		- [ ] get 6 sup rests, keep trying to join, there will be an instance. sticky fungus sucks. maybe hit 10 fm and see if it's any better
		- [ ] 15 fm was quick, and all that i needed
## Monday morning
- [ ] create acc with brandon
- [ ] grab hood
- [ ] tele mind altar
- [ ] make runes
- [ ] unlock edge lode
- [ ] tele runespan
## Work
- [ ] AFK summoning/runespan
## Lunch
- [ ] do wfe far west shallow wildy div
	- [ ] wfe will be div, should be equal exp to 30/100 pts cache, gives other mats, and easier to execute
- [ ] modify initial path to get to anachronia quicker.
	- [ ] is this necessary? might be able to just do it anyways
- [ ] execute path to anachronia, do herby werby and then double ljot
	- [ ] double ljot reqs, does necro change this? can replace the most annoying skill with it potentially!
		- [ ] don't tele south feldip, only good if you have 60 div for vibrant wisps and 76 arch to get something from there. alt use arch journ to do anything in kharid-et and use necro inst of div
		- [ ] do agi course inst of mouse until 33 craft and 42 con
		- [ ] inv will have to be replaced with div, really annoying but after rc in runespan, run to pale wisps after until 10 div, can then do fally lode
- [ ] daily challenges, remember will have some skip tokens if that makes sense to use them.
	- [ ] use skips now rather than after i'm off, more time constrained during lunch
- [ ] if i can get stronghold done before lunch is over, buy bricks in case they reset-based restock
## Work
- [ ] resume afking event summ/runespan
## Home
- [ ] double ljot again
	- [ ] maybe delay til 10 div after caches so i don't have to run from wizard's tower to pale colony
- [ ] daily challenges again
- [ ] wfe sched (if no good wfe, do cache)
	- [ ] 6p- butterfly swarm next to lode (pick up!) for hunt
	- [ ] 7p- cache 1/2
		- [ ] try to have fally lode unlocked by now so caches are easy to get to
	- [ ] 8p- cache 2/2
	- [ ] 9p- surprising seedlings farm
	- [ ] 10p- combat, not staying up til 11p to get the next one, but unlikely i'll have 200 points from caches, so can do another cache before sleepy
- [ ] nemi
	- [ ] step 86 after holy grail prayer xp, if i'm not gonna get there, just do it end of day anyways
	- [ ] move poh req:
		- [ ] 1750 goebie rep from dailies or tms
		- [ ] 60 con
		- [ ] 40 mag to cast
	- [ ] before poh moved:
		- [ ] lumb lode -> s -> wizard chambers, into world window, talk to ranger
- [ ] sus reaper
	- [ ] 25 qp first, visit mazcab for 3 super rests, hit 15 fm after vib2
- [ ] soul obby? - prolly not
	- [ ] req jack of spades, 6k port dist rep first goal
	- [ ] will want to have food online, stealing cakes maybe good enough,
	- [ ] rc xp is dog water below like 20, try it to verify, but probably not worth. 
	- [ ] gives rc, pray exp too, if pray < 50, 2x rc xp, pretty nice, saves time on runespan for vis wax
- [ ] phas the list recommends doing jack of spades for mena access first, but otherwise just talk to npc in ardy zoo when doing monk's friend
	- locations:
		- gnome maze, do while unlocking yan lode
		- rellekka, maybe do if i get to seers lode day 1 or not, just 1pt, prolly not worth prio just for it
		- desert at kq lair might not be so bad to get to if i unlock ak lode after arch tut
		- desert at tardis, take carpet to pollnivneach
		- wildy pengs, maybe try to get if i'm doing wfe, but might be too dangerous cos of mobs
			- mage bank
			- south central
			- n kbd
	- for week 2, weigh prioritizing location unlocks for more points, but won't have general bonuses online for a bit
- [ ] agoroth
	- quest is step 153, but no real reqs, so move it closer
	- location-wise what's best?
		- do it when in sarim for swept away
- [ ] familiarisation
	- once every 2h, talk with pikkenmix in tav to see where. can do this whenever it pops, check f3
- [ ]  meg, do when grabbing sarim lode during swept away

# Before Thursday
- First monthly reset is 5pm thu
- will have a monthly reset token, use on
	- oyster if unlocked,
	- else: troll inv/god statues
- troll inv has no reqs, but combat might be rough, try doing skilling method
- giant oyster
	- beneath cursed tides
		- 30 in:
			- att
				- waterfall
			- cook
				- [dairy churn](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ironman_Mode/Strategies/Cooking#Dairy_churn): req chef's assistant
			- fm
				- bonfire in VIB town for 4% xp boost (didn't know!)
			- mage
				- shattered worlds, gross, but prolly like 30m to hit 30. 
			- min
				- wmiy
			- smith
				- wimy
			- str
				- waterfall
			- wc
				- can get to 22 via icthlarin/monks friend, but will need to chop logs for fm anyways, so maybe don't prio icthlarin just for that
		- follow normal path, but if by end of tue, it's not looking close, maybe train skills to make it happen or prio quests with xp rewards
- god statues
	- follow normal path, if not done with holy grail at this point, just send it
- effigy inc is lategame
- [ ] spec wfe, can only do bloodwood tree until established in combat:
	- [ ] mon 1p, maybe can do, but would be rough cos marco may unload tix on me
	- [ ] tue 3a not staying up for that shit
	- [ ] wed 5p, can't happen due to driving home, could clock out and do it at work and drive home but kinda cringe
	- [ ] wed 7a, not waking up for that shit
	- [ ] thu 9p, can and will do
	- [ ] thu 11a, working, but maybe
	- [ ] fri 1a, nope
	- [ ] fri 3p, working
	- [ ] sat 5a,  nope
	- [ ] sun 7p, can and will
	- [ ] sun 9a, if i'm up that early, send it
	- [ ] mon 11p, prolly too late
